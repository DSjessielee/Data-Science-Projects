    "**Computer’s brains.** The computer must be able to exploit some human biases. If the human has played Rock most often, the computer should assume that he or she will play Rock in the next round, so the computer should play Paper. If the human has played Rock and Paper equally often, and Scissors less often, the computer should assume that the human is going to play either Rock or Paper (both equally likely) in the next round. (What should the computer play?)\n",
